# Sql2o 1.2.0 released
_<small>14 jan 2014 <a href="https://github.com/aaberg">Lars Aaberg</a> </small>_

It has been quite a while since the last release of sql2o. But the project hasn't been dormant! A lot of people have
contributed and a lot of new features has been added and quite a few bugs has been fixed. I am excited to announce that
all the effort has resulted in the release of version 1.2.0 of sql2o!

Here is a list of new features:

#####- Auto mapping of field names with underscore.  <a href="https://github.com/aaberg/sql2o/pull/33"><span class="badge badge-info">#33</span></a>  
>As of version 1.2.0, a database column with name “field_name”, will automatically be mapped to a java property with name “fieldName”.

#####- getObject() method now has an overload that uses a registered converter. <a href="https://github.com/aaberg/sql2o/issues/32"><span class="badge badge-info">#32</span></a>
>Example   
>MyModel value = query.getObject(“colname”, MyModel.class);
